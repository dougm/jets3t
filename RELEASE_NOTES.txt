Version 0.4.1
-------------

* Toolkit 
- Properties for many aspects of jets3t behaviour can be set by the user
- Support for getting/setting Server Access Logging for buckets.
- Improved encryption mechanism, which now uses PBE-based encryption and allows users to set 
  their preferred algorithm. 
  NOTE: All changes *should* be backwards compatible, but due to these changes there may be 
  an increased risk of data loss for encrypted items.
- New methods to chunk bucket listings, allowing for better handling of buckets with many objects.
- A limit to the maximum number of simultaneous communication threads (ie those interacting with S3) 
  is now imposed. This limit can be set in the properties file, and defaults to 50.
- Signed URLs correctly encode object key names prior to signing.
- The REST/HTTP implementation is now less fussy about object key names, and will allow unusual 
  names such as full URL strings etc.
- The REST/HTTP implementation *may* be better at detecting a browser's proxy settings when run
  inside an applet context. This functionality is largely untested...

* Cockpit

- Remembered login credentials are automatically updated to the new encryption version.
- Third-party buckets can be added without first logging in.
- User can cancel the listing of objects in large buckets

* Synchronize


* Known issues
