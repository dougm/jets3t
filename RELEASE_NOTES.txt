Version 0.5.0
-------------

TOOLKIT

  * General

- Properties for many aspects of jets3t behaviour can be set by the user
- Support for getting/setting Server Access Logging for buckets.
- Improved encryption mechanism, which now uses PBE-based encryption and allows users to set 
  their preferred algorithm. 
  NOTE: All changes *should* be backwards compatible, but due to these changes there may be 
  an increased risk of data loss for encrypted items.
- New methods to chunk bucket listings, allowing for better handling of buckets with many objects.
- A limit to the maximum number of simultaneous communication threads (ie those interacting with S3) 
  is now imposed. This limit can be set in the properties file, and defaults to 50.
- Signed URLs can be generated for GET and PUT HTTP requests, and will correctly encode object key 
  names with special characters.
- DNS caching is limited to 300 seconds
  
  * REST/HTTP implementation
  
- Requests that fail due to S3 Internal Server error are retried a configurable number of times,
  with an increasing delay between each retry attempt.
- The REST/HTTP implementation is now less fussy about object key names, and will allow unusual 
  names such as full URL strings etc.
- Can detect (in some circumstances) a browser's proxy settings when run inside an applet context,
  and allows for callbacks to a credentials provider object when authentication is required
  (eg for proxies requiring username/password)
- Added a utility method putObjectWithSignedUrl to upload objects to S3 using only a signed 
  PUT URL (ie no AWS credentials are required).
- Configurable user agent string.

COCKPIT

- Remembered login credentials are automatically updated to the new PBE-based encryption files.
- Third-party buckets can be added without first logging in.
- User can cancel the listing of objects in large buckets
