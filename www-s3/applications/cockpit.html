        <h1>JetS3t Cockpit</h1>

        <p>Cockpit is a graphical Java application for viewing and
        managing the contents of an <a href=
        "http://s3.amazonaws.com">Amazon S3</a> account. It is
        freely available as part of the <a href=
        "http://jets3t.dev.java.net">jets3t</a> project which
        provides applications and a Java toolkit for Amazon's
        S3.</p>

        <p>Cockpit can also be run as an online applet, available
        at <a href=
        "http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/cockpit/applet.html">Cockpit
        Online</a>.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Cockpit.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Cockpit application" /></p>

        <h3>Running Cockpit</h3>

        <p>Cockpit may be run as a stand-alone application or as a
        browser applet.</p>

        <p>To run the online browser applet visit <a href=
        "http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">Cockpit
        Online</a>.</p>

        <p>To obtain the stand-alone version download the <a href=
        "/downloads.html">JetS3t distribution</a> and unzip the
        archive on your machine. Cockpit can then be run using the
        included cockpit start scripts.</p>

        <h3><a name="login"
           id="login">Log in</a></h3>

        <p>When Cockpit starts, or when you select the <b>Service
        -&gt; Log in...</b> menu item, the login dialog will be
        displayed. This dialog allows you to log in to S3, and also
        to manage your AWS login credentials by storing them in
        encrypted files with your own password.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/LoginDialog.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Login Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>The login dialog offers a choice of three ways to
        provide your credentials:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Direct Login</b>: Simply provide your AWS access
          and secret keys by copying and pasting them from Amazon's
          AWS Access Identifiers page. Your credentials are not
          stored anywhere.</li>

          <li><b>Local Folder</b>: Your credentials are stored in a
          folder of your choice on your computer, or on any disk
          available to your computer (such as a USB thumb
          drive).</li>

          <li><b>S3 Online</b>: Your credentials are stored online
          in your S3 account and can only be accessed with the
          correct Passphrase and Password.
          <br />
          The credentials are stored in a private bucket whose name
          is based on a hash of your passphrase. The credentials
          file itself is publicly readable but the object's name
          cannot be guessed as it is based on a hash of your
          password, as well as being encrypted with this
          password.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To store your credentials using <b>S3 Online</b> or
        <b>Local Folder</b> first choose the option <i>Store</i> in
        answer to the quetion "Would you like to log in or store
        your credentials?". Enter a password to encrypt your
        credentials, and a passphrase for <b>S3 Online</b>, and
        click the <b>Store Credentials</b> button. You will be
        prompted to enter your AWS Access Key and Secret Key which
        will be stored.</p>

        <h3><a name="buckets"
           id="buckets">Manage your buckets</a></h3>

        <p>Once you have logged in to S3 you can manage your
        buckets. Upon log in all your buckets will automatically be
        displayed in Cockpit's left pane under the heading
        <b>Buckets</b>. If your buckets list is empty, it's about
        time you created a bucket!</p>

        <p>To create a bucket, click the bucket action button (it
        has a gear icon and is on the top-right of the buckets
        pane) and choose the menu item <b>Create new bucket...</b>.
        You will be prompted to name your bucket. Notice that the
        default new bucket name includes your Amazon S3 ID string.
        It is a good idea to leave this string as a prefix for your
        bucket names to ensure your names are unique in the S3
        system.</p>

        <p>When you select a bucket name in the left pane Cockpit
        will list the objects stored in that bucket. This list will
        be displayed in the right-hand pane under the heading
        <b>Objects</b>.</p>

        <h4>Bucket Menu</h4>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/BucketMenu.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Bucket Menu" /></p>

        <p>The Buckets menu shows all the operations you can
        perform on your buckets.
        <br />
        For convenience this menu can also be displayed as a
        context menu if you right-click a bucket name.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Refresh bucket listing</b>: When Cockpit first
          logs in it caches the list of bucekts at that time. Use
          this menu item to refresh your bucket listing manually,
          to be sure the listing is up-to-date.</li>

          <li><b>View bucket properties...</b>: Displays the
          bucket's properties such as its creation date.</li>

          <li><b>Update bucket's Access Control List...</b>: View
          and change the access permissions of the selected bucket
          (see <a href="#acls">Access Control Lists</a>)</li>

          <li><b>Create new bucket...</b>: Creates a new
          bucket</li>

          <li><b>Add third-party bucket...</b>: A third-party
          bucket is one owned by someone else but which is publicly
          accessible, or accessible to you. You can manually add
          third-party buckets to your listing with this menu item,
          and once you have done so you can perform whatever
          operations you like provided you have the necessary
          permissions. For example, the <u>jets3t</u> bucket
          containing <a href=
          "http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">Cockpit
          Online</a> is publicly readable, so you can add this to
          your bucket listing. However you won't be allowed to do
          anything but look, sorry...</li>

          <li><b>Delete bucket...</b>: Deletes the bucket after
          prompting for confirmation. Note that you can only delete
          empty buckets - if you try to delete a bucket containing
          some objects you will get an error message.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="objects"
           id="objects">Manage your objects</a></h3>

        <p>When you log in to S3 and select a bucket the objects
        contained in that bucket are listed in the right-hand pane
        under the heading <b>Objects</b>. You can upload files to
        S3 by dragging-and-dropping them on the objects pane, or by
        using the Object Menu as described below.</p>

        <h4>Object Menu</h4>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/ObjectMenu.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Object Menu" /></p>

        <p>The <b>Objects</b> menu shows all the operations you can
        perform on your objects.
        <br />
        For convenience this menu can also be displayed as a
        context menu if you right-click an object in the list.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Refresh object listing</b>: When Cockpit lists the
          contents of a bucket it caches the list of objects to
          avoid having to look them up again. Use this menu item to
          refresh your object listing manually, to be sure it is
          up-to-date.</li>

          <li><b>View object properties...</b>: Displays objects'
          properties, such as their size, content type, and all
          metadata items.
          <br /></li>

          <li><b>Update object(s) Access Control List(s)...</b>:
          View and change the access permissions of the selected
          object(s) (see <a href="#acls">Access Control
          Lists</a>)</li>

          <li><b>Download object(s)...</b>: This menu item will
          prompt for a target directory, then download all the
          selected objects into that directory. If the objects
          being downloaded were stored in a directory structure (eg
          if you uploaded a directory containing other directories
          and files) that directory structure will be re-created in
          the target location.</li>

          <li><b>Upload file(s)...</b>: This menu item will prompt
          you to choose some files and/or folders to upload.</li>

          <li><b>Generate Public GET URL...</b>: Generates a
          time-limited GET URL string that will allow anyone with
          the URL to access an object for a limited amount of time.
          This operation will prompt you for the number of hours
          until the URL will expire (the number can be a fraction,
          eg 0.5 for 30 minutes) and will generate the appropriate
          signed URL. See <a href="#signedurls">Time-limited
          URLs</a>.</li>

          <li><b>Generate Torrent URL...</b>: Generates a URL that
          points to a BitTorrent file, allowing the object to be
          downloaded with a BitTorrent client application.</li>

          <li><b>Delete object(s)</b>: Deletes the currently
          selected object or objects, after prompting for
          confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="uploads"
           id="uploads">Upload files to S3</a></h3>

        <p>You upload files to S3 by selecting a target bucket,
        then either dragging-and-dropping files onto the Objects
        listing or selecting the Object Menu item <b>Upload
        file(s)...</b>. Before uploading, Cockpit examines the
        files (this may take some time for large files) and uploads
        them to S3 provided there are no clashes (see <a href=
        "#comparisons">Automatic File Comparisons</a>).</p>

        <p>Cockpit displays a progress dialog during uploads
        showing how much of the total data has been uploaded.
        Uploads can be cancelled at any time.</p>

        <p>If a folder is uploaded Cockpit will upload the folder
        and all its contents, storing enough information to
        re-create the folder structure exactly when it is
        downloaded. It does this by creating an empty object for
        each folder or sub-folder, and tagging the object with the
        content type <tt>application/x-directory</tt>.</p>

        <h4><a name="ulprefs"
           id="ulprefs">Upload Preferences</a></h4>

        <p>Cockpit can be instructed to perform additional tasks
        when it uploads files by setting Upload options in the
        Cockpit Preferences dialog box available from the menu item
        <b>Tools -&gt; Preferences...</b>.</p>

        <p>Preferences are not saved by Cockpit, and will have to
        be re-set each time you run the application.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/PreferencesDialog.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Preferences Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>The Upload preferences allow you to set:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>ACL Permissions</b>: The Access Control List
          permissions to apply to uploaded objects.</li>

          <li><b>Compression</b>: Whether to compress (gzip) files
          before uploading them.
          <br />
          Compressing files may save space in S3 and reduce the
          time taken for uploads provided the files compress well,
          however note that some files such as movies and music do
          not generally compress well.</li>

          <li><b>Encryption</b>: Whether to encrypt files before
          uploading them. If encryption is turned on you must also
          set a password in the Encryption preferences section.
          <br />
          Encrypting files may help to protect sensitive
          information, especially if you don't trust the operators
          of S3. The encryption relies on a password you provide,
          and files will only be readable by someone with that
          password.
          <br />
          <b>Note:</b> Beware of using more than one password in a
          bucket, as Cockpit is only smart enough to handle one
          password at a time when downloading.</li>

          <li style="list-style: none">
            <p>Please be aware that Cockpit does not presume to
            offer industrial-strength encryption - by default it
            uses a standard low-strength algorithm available in all
            versions of Java (PBEWithMD5AndDES). This algorithm can
            be changed using the advanced configuration options
            available in JetS3t, but doing so is not easy.</p>

            <h3><a name="downloads"
               id="downloads">Download files from S3</a></h3>

            <p>Cockpit does not allow files to be downloaded using
            drag-and-drop - unfortunately the Java Swing library
            makes this infeasible. To download objects from S3 you
            must select the objects you want, then choose the
            Object Menu item <b>Download object(s)</b>.</p>

            <p>Before downloading Cockpit compares any files
            present in the target location against the objects in
            S3 and detects any clashes (see <a href=
            "#comparisons">Automatic File Comparisons</a>). If you
            download objects contained in a folder structure, that
            folder structure will be re-created exactly on your
            computer (provided the files were initially uploaded
            with a jets3t tool).</p>

            <p>Cockpit will automatically unzip GZipped objects and
            decrypt Encrypted objects, though you will have to set
            your encryption password in the Cockpit Preferences
            dialog before you can download encrypted objects.</p>

            <h3><a name="acls"
               id="acls">Access Control Lists</a></h3>

            <p>Amazon S3 uses Access Control List (ACL) settings to
            control who may access or modify items stored in S3. By
            default, all buckets and objects created in S3 are
            accessible only to the account owner - they are
            completely private.</p>

            <p>Cockpit allows you to change the ACL settings for a
            bucket, or for one or more objects, by selecting the
            Update Access Control List menu item in the bucket or
            object menus. ACL settings are managed in the Update
            Access Control List dialog.</p>

                 "Picture of the Access Control Listing Dialog window" /></p>

            <p>The default ACL setting is for the object's creator,
            represented by a Canonical ID, to have Full
            control.</p>

            <p>The most common ACL change is to allow public access
            to a bucket or object. An object is made publicly
            accessible in S3 by granting READ access to members of
            the All Users group. To do this:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Click the plus (+) button underneath the Group
              Grantees table, to add a new Group permission</li>

              <li>Make sure the Group URI is set to
              <tt>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers</tt>
              by double-clicking the URI and selecting it</li>

              <li>Set the Permission option to <tt>READ</tt> if
              necessary by double-clicking it</li>

              <li>Save the changes using the <b>Save Permission
              Changes</b> button</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Note that you can also used <a href=
            "#signedurls">signed GET URLs</a> to make an object
            publicly available for a limited time.</p>

            <p>Although all ACL combinations supported by Amazon S3
            can be managed using this dialog box, this is a complex
            topic and we won't deal with it here. Please refer to
            Amazon's technical documentation for more information
            about the use of Access Control Lists.</p>

            <h3><a name="filecomparisions"
               id="filecomparisions">Automatic File
               Comparisons</a></h3>

            <p>Cockpit automatically compares files that are being
            uploaded or downloaded with files in the destination to
            detect clashes. When a file with the same name exists
            on the target, Cockpit determines whether the file has
            changed, and if so which version of the file is the
            most recent.</p>

            <p>Each file is given one of the following status
            types:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>New File: The file does not exist in the
              destination</li>

              <li>Unchanged: The file is identical to the copy in
              the destination</li>

              <li>Changed: The file has been changed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If there are Unchanged or Changed files, the
            <b>Replace file(s)</b> dialog is displayed.</p>

            <p><img src="cockpit_assets/FileComparisonsDialog.jpg"
                 alt=
                 "Picture of the File Comparisons Dialog window" /></p>

            <p>This dialog allows you to choose which clashing
            files in the destination should be replaced, if any.
            The options available may include the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Only upload/download new file(s)</b>: Only
              files that do not already exist in the destination
              will be uploaded or downloaded. No existing file will
              be over-written.</li>

              <li><b>Upload/download new and changed file(s)</b>:
              New files and changed files will be transferred, but
              files that are unchanged will not be transferred.
              Only out-dated files will be over-written.</li>

              <li><b>Upload/Download all files</b>: All the files
              will be uploaded or downloaded, regardless of what
              files are in the destination. Any existing files will
              be over-written.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>File comparisons are performed using MD5 hashes of
            the file contents.</p>

            <h3><a name="signedurls"
               id="signedurls">Signed GET URLs</a></h3>

            <p>A private object stored in S3 can be made publicy
            available for a limited time using a signed GET URL.
            The signed URL can be used by anyone to download the
            object by using the URL in their web browser, up until
            a chosen time after which the URL will no longer
            work.</p>

            <p>Time limited URLs are created using Object Menu item
            <b>Generate Public GET URL...</b>. A dialog is
            displayed prompting for the number of hours until the
            URL will expire. This number can be a fraction, for
            example the value 0.5 will create a URL which works for
            half an hour.</p>

            <p><img src="cockpit_assets/SignedGetURLDialog.jpg"
                 alt=
                 "Picture of the Signed GET URL Dialog window" /></p>

            <p>After providing the number of hours the dialog box
            will contain a lengthy URL. This URL will work in any
            web browser, but only for the length of time you
            specified. Send this URL to the person who needs the
            object.</p>
