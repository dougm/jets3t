        <h1>JetS3t Cockpit</h1>

        <p>Cockpit is a graphical Java application for viewing and
        managing the contents of an <a href=
        "http://s3.amazonaws.com">Amazon S3</a> account. It is
        freely available as part of the JetS3t project, which
        provides applications and a Java toolkit for Amazon's
        S3.</p>

        <p>To run Cockpit as a Java Applet in your web browser
        visit the Cockpit Online page:
        <br />
        <a target="_blank"
           href=
           "../applets-jets3t-0.6.1/jets3t-cockpit.html"><font size=

        <br />
        <sup>Version 0.6.1, approximate download size 3 MB</sup>
        <br />
        Sun's JRE plugin version 1.4 or later is required, and you

        applet.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Cockpit.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Cockpit application" /></p>

        <p>Cockpit offers the following capabilities:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Manage <a href="#buckets">buckets</a> and <a href=
          "#objects">objects</a> in your Amazon S3 account</li>

          <li>Specify where your buckets will be <a href=
          "#location">located</a>, in Europe or the United
          States</li>

          <li><a href="#uploads">Upload</a> and <a href=

          objects within and between buckets</li>

          <li><a href="#copy-move-rename">Rename<font color=
          "red">*</font></a> one or more S3 objects</li>

          <li><a href="#update-metadata">Update the
          metadata<font color="red">*</font></a> associated with S3
          objects</li>

          <li>Manage <a href="#acls">Access Control List (ACL)
          permissions</a> for buckets and objects</li>

          <li>Choose <a href="#ulprefs">default ACL</a> permissions

          writable</li>

          <li>Automatically <a href="#ulprefs">compress (gzip)</a>
          and/or <a href="#ulprefs">encrypt</a> uploaded files. The
          encryption algorithm is configurable in Cockpit's
          preferences.</li>

          <li>Uses sophisticated <a href="#filecomparisions">file
          comparison</a> techniques to determine whether files have
          changed prior to uploading or downloading them,
          preventing unnecessary or accidental transfers</li>

          <li>Easily generate <a href="#signedurls">signed GET
          URLs</a> to make your private objects publicly available
          to others for a limited time. If your bucket is available
          via a virutal host name, create a URL that references
          this domain</li>

        <h3>Running Cockpit</h3>

        <p>Cockpit may be run as a stand-alone application or as a
        browser applet.</p>

        <p>To run the online browser applet visit <a href=
        "http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/applets-jets3t-0.6.1/jets3t-cockpit.html">
        Cockpit Online</a>.</p>

        <p>To obtain the stand-alone version download the <a href=
        "http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.html">JetS3t
        distribution</a> and unzip the archive on your machine.
        Cockpit can then be run using the included cockpit start
        scripts.</p>

        <h3><a name="login">Log in</a></h3>

        <p>When Cockpit starts, or when you select the <b>Service
        -&gt; Log in...</b> menu item, the login dialog will be
        displayed. This dialog allows you to log in to S3, and also
        to manage your AWS login credentials by storing them in
        encrypted files with your own password.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/LoginDialog.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Login Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>The login dialog offers a choice of three ways to
        provide your credentials:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Direct Login</b>: Simply provide your AWS access
          and secret keys by copying and pasting them from Amazon's
          AWS Access Identifiers page. Your credentials are not
          stored anywhere.</li>

          <li><b>Local Folder</b>: Your credentials are stored in a
          folder of your choice on your computer, or on any disk
          available to your computer (such as a USB thumb
          drive).</li>

          <li><b>S3 Online</b>: Your credentials are stored online
          in your S3 account and can only be accessed with the
          correct Passphrase and Password.
          <br />
          The credentials are stored in a private bucket whose name
          is based on a hash of your passphrase. The credentials
          file itself is publicly readable but the object's name
          cannot be guessed as it is based on a hash of your
          password, as well as being encrypted with this
          password.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To store your credentials using <b>S3 Online</b> or
        <b>Local Folder</b> first choose the option <i>Store</i> in
        answer to the quetion "Would you like to log in or store
        your credentials?". Enter a password to encrypt your
        credentials, and a passphrase for <b>S3 Online</b>, and
        click the <b>Store Credentials</b> button. You will be
        prompted to enter your AWS Access Key and Secret Key which
        will be stored.</p>

        <h3><a name="buckets">Manage your buckets</a></h3>

        <p>Once you have logged in to S3 you can manage your
        buckets. Upon log in all your buckets will automatically be
        displayed in Cockpit's left pane under the heading
        <b>Buckets</b>. If your buckets list is empty, it's about
        time you created a bucket!</p>

        <p>To create a bucket, click the bucket action button (it
        has a gear icon and is on the top-right of the buckets
        pane) and choose the menu item <b>Create new bucket...</b>.
        You will be prompted to name your bucket. Notice that the
        default new bucket name includes your Amazon S3 ID string.
        It is a good idea to leave this string as a prefix for your
        bucket names to ensure your names are unique in the S3
        system.</p>

        <p>When you select a bucket name in the left pane Cockpit
        will list the objects stored in that bucket. This list will
        be displayed in the right-hand pane under the heading
        <b>Objects</b>.</p>

        <h4>Bucket Menu</h4>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/BucketMenu.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Bucket Menu" /></p>

        <p>The Buckets menu shows all the operations you can
        perform on your buckets.
        <br />
        For convenience this menu can also be displayed as a
        context menu if you right-click a bucket name.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Refresh bucket listing</b>: When Cockpit first
          logs in it caches the list of bucekts at that time. Use
          this menu item to refresh your bucket listing manually,
          to be sure the listing is up-to-date.</li>

          <li><b>View bucket properties...</b>: Displays the
          bucket's properties such as its creation date.</li>

          <li><b>Update bucket's Access Control List...</b>: View
          and change the access permissions of the selected bucket
          (see <a href="#acls">Access Control Lists</a>)</li>

          <li><b>Create new bucket...</b>: Creates a new
          bucket</li>

          <li><b>Add third-party bucket...</b>: A third-party
          bucket is one owned by someone else but which is publicly
          accessible, or accessible to you. You can manually add
          third-party buckets to your listing with this menu item,
          and once you have done so you can perform whatever
          operations you like provided you have the necessary
          permissions. For example, the <u>jets3t</u> bucket
          containing <a href=
          "http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">Cockpit
          Online</a> is publicly readable, so you can add this to
          your bucket listing. However you won't be allowed to do
          anything but look, sorry...</li>

          <li><b>Delete bucket...</b>: Deletes the bucket after
          prompting for confirmation. Note that you can only delete
          empty buckets - if you try to delete a bucket containing
          some objects you will get an error message.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="location">Bucket Location</a></h3>

        <p>When you create a bucket, Cockpit allows you to specify
        the bucket's name and the Amazon data centre location where
        the bucket will be created. A bucket may be located in the
        United States (the default location) or in Europe. Bucket's
        located in Europe will incur additional storage and access
        fees.</p>

        <p>To create a bucket in the European (EU) location, the
        bucket's name must be a valid component of a DNS host name.
        Names which will not be valid as part of a host name cannot
        be used for buckets in the EU location, or for buckets that
        will be accessible via S3's virtual hosting feature. The
        Create Bucket dialog box provides feedback on whether or
        not the bucket name you have chosen is a valid DNS host
        name component.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Cockpit_CreateBucket.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Create Bucket dialog" /></p>

        <p>As a general rule, DNS-compatible bucket names must be
        longer than 3 characters and must contain only lower-case
        letters, hyphens or full-stops.</p>

        <h3><a name="logging">Bucket Logging</a></h3>

        <p>Cockpit includes support for the new (beta) <a target=
        "_blank"
           href=
           "http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=422&amp;categoryID=49">
        Server Access Logging</a> capabilities of S3. Server Access
        Logging allows you to specific that some or all of your
        buckets will have their activity logged by Amazon. Amazon
        then delivers log files summarising the activity on your
        logged buckets to a bucket of your choice.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/BucketLogging.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Bucket Logging dialog" /></p>

        <p>To activate logging for a bucket, start the Bucket
        Logging Status dialog via the menu <b>Tools -&gt; Configure
        Bucket logging...</b>. In this dialog you simply choose a
        bucket to be logged from the <b>Bucket</b> list, set a log
        file prefix (text added as a prefix to the generated log
        files), and select a bucket to log to from the <b>Log
        to</b> list. Any changes you make in this dialog are
        applied when the <b>Log to</b> bucket is changed or
        selected.</p>

        <p>The Bucket Logging Status dialog also shows the status
        of bucket logging for the selected <b>Bucket</b>. In other
        words, selecting a bucket from the <b>Bucket</b> list will
        cause Cockpit to query S3 for that bucket's logging status,
        which will then be displayed. Once the current status is
        displayed, you can change it or leave it as it is.</p>

        <p>Be aware that the <b>Log to</b> bucket used for Server
        Access Logging must have special ACL permissions to allow
        the Amazon logging service to write log files to it. The
        ACL settings required are that the Amazon Logging group
        (http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/Delivery) have both
        READ_ACP and WRITE permission. Cockpit <i>automatically
        makes the necessary ACL changes</i> when you choose a
        <b>Log to</b> bucket in the Bucket Logging Status dialog,
        but if you wish to remove these settings later on you will
        have to do this yourself using the standard Bucket ACL
        Permissions dialog.</p>

        <h3><a name="objects">Manage your objects</a></h3>

        <p>When you log in to S3 and select a bucket the objects
        contained in that bucket are listed in the right-hand pane
        under the heading <b>Objects</b>. You can upload files to
        S3 by dragging-and-dropping them on the objects pane, or by
        using the Object Menu as described below.</p>

        <h4>Object Menu</h4>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Cockpit_ObjectMenu.gif"
             alt="Picture of the Object Menu" /></p>

        <p>The <b>Objects</b> menu shows all the operations you can
        perform on your objects.
        <br />
        For convenience this menu can also be displayed as a
        context menu if you right-click an object in the list.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Refresh object listing</b>: When Cockpit lists the
          contents of a bucket it caches the list of objects to
          avoid having to look them up again. Use this menu item to
          refresh your object listing manually, to be sure it is
          up-to-date.</li>

          <li><b>View or Modify object attributes...</b>: Displays
          objects' properties, such as their size, content type,
          and their metadata information. You can <a href=
          "#update-metadata">modify the metadata</a> information
          associated with objects.</li>

          <li><b>Copy or Move objects...</b>: Displays a dialog
          that allows you to <a href="#copy-move-rename">copy, move
          or rename</a> objects within or between your S3
          buckets.</li>

          <li><b>View or Modify Access Control Lists...</b>: View
          and change the access permissions of the selected
          object(s) (see <a href="#acls">Access Control
          Lists</a>)</li>

          <li><b>Download objects...</b>: This menu item will
          prompt for a target directory, then download all the
          selected objects into that directory. If the objects
          being downloaded were stored in a directory structure (eg
          if you uploaded a directory containing other directories
          and files) that directory structure will be re-created in
          the target location.</li>

          <li><b>Upload files...</b>: This menu item will prompt
          you to choose some files and/or folders to upload.</li>

          <li><b>Generate Public GET URL...</b>: Generates a
          time-limited GET URL string that will allow anyone with
          the URL to access an object for a limited amount of time.
          This operation will prompt you for the number of hours
          until the URL will expire (the number can be a fraction,
          eg 0.5 for 30 minutes) and will generate the appropriate
          signed URL. See <a href="#signedurls">Time-limited
          URLs</a>.</li>

          <li><b>Generate Torrent URL...</b>: Generates a URL that
          points to a BitTorrent file, allowing the object to be
          downloaded with a BitTorrent client application.</li>

          <li><b>Delete objects...</b>: Deletes the currently
          selected object or objects, after prompting for
          confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="filtering">Object Filtering</a></h3>

        <p>Cockpit allows you to apply filtering to determine which
        objects are listed in the objects pane. This filtering
        provides a convenient way to reduce the number of objects
        displayed by Cockpit, and as the filtering is applied by S3
        when listing objects it can also greatly reduce the time
        required to list the relevant contents of buckets with many
        objects.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Filtering.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Filtering options" /></p>

        <p>Filtering is turned on by selecting the <b>Filter
        objects</b> check box. By default no filtering is applied
        as the <b>Prefix</b> and <b>Delimiter</b> filtering options
        are blank. Filtering is applied by entering a prefix or a
        delimiter or both:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Prefix</b>: Only objects with keys that start with
          the prefix will be listed. The prefix can be anything
          from a partial string or single character, up to the
          entire name of an object.
          <br />
          If object keys are divided into logical "directories" in
          your S3 account using forward-slashes (/), or indeed any
          character, only the contents of a "directory" can be
          displayed by using the directory name and the slash (eg
          "Documents/").</li>

          <li><b>Delimiter</b>: Only objects with keys that match
          the prefix (if it set) and that end with the delimiter
          will be displayed. The delimiter is most useful when your
          object keys are divided into logical "directories"
          separated by a character, such as a forward-slash (/). In
          this case, specifying "/" as the delimiter will limit the
          object listing to only top-level items or
          directories.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Filtering can be applied before objects are listed, such
        as by specifying a filter before clicking on a bucket for
        the first time- this is particularly useful for buckets
        with many objects. Alternately, filtering can be applied on
        a current listing by changing the prefix and/or delimiter
        and pressing return to trigger a refresh of the
        objects.</p>

        <p>The exact behaviour of the S3 filtering mechanism can be
        a little hard to understand, so play around with it to get
        a feel for how it works. There is also some documentation
        available in the Amazon Resource Center's S3 Developer
        Guide, in the section on <a target="_blank"
           href=
           "http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/ListingKeysHierarchy.html">
        Listing Keys Hierarchically</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="uploads">Upload files to S3</a></h3>

        <p>You upload files to S3 by selecting a target bucket,
        then either dragging-and-dropping files onto the Objects
        listing or selecting the Object Menu item <b>Upload
        file(s)...</b>. Before uploading, Cockpit examines the
        files (this may take some time for large files) and uploads
        them to S3 provided there are no clashes (see <a href=
        "#comparisons">Automatic File Comparisons</a>).</p>

        <p>Cockpit displays a progress dialog during uploads
        showing how much of the total data has been uploaded.
        Uploads can be cancelled at any time.</p>

        <p>If a folder is uploaded Cockpit will upload the folder
        and all its contents, storing enough information to
        re-create the folder structure exactly when it is
        downloaded. It does this by creating an empty object for
        each folder or sub-folder, and tagging the object with the
        content type <tt>application/x-directory</tt>.</p>

        <h4><a name="ulprefs">Upload Preferences</a></h4>

        <p>Cockpit can be instructed to perform additional tasks
        when it uploads files by setting Upload options in the
        Cockpit Preferences dialog box available from the menu item
        <b>Tools -&gt; Preferences...</b>.</p>

        <p>Preferences are not saved by Cockpit, and will have to
        be re-set each time you run the application.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/PreferencesDialog.jpg"
             alt="Picture of the Preferences Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>The Upload preferences allow you to set:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>ACL Permissions</b>: The Access Control List
          permissions to apply to uploaded objects.</li>

          <li><b>Compression</b>: Whether to compress (gzip) files
          before uploading them.
          <br />
          Compressing files may save space in S3 and reduce the
          time taken for uploads provided the files compress well,
          however note that some files such as movies and music do
          not generally compress well.</li>

          <li><b>Encryption</b>: Whether to encrypt files before
          uploading them. If encryption is turned on you must also
          set a password in the Encryption preferences section.
          <br />
          Encrypting files may help to protect sensitive
          information, especially if you don't trust the operators
          of S3. The encryption relies on a password you provide,
          and files will only be readable by someone with that
          password.
          <br />
          <b>Note:</b> Beware of using more than one password in a
          bucket, as Cockpit is only smart enough to handle one
          password at a time when downloading.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please be aware that Cockpit does not presume to offer
        industrial-strength encryption - by default it uses a
        standard low-strength algorithm available in all versions
        of Java (PBEWithMD5AndDES). This algorithm can be changed
        using the advanced configuration options available in
        JetS3t, but doing so is not easy.</p>

        <h3><a name="downloads">Download files from S3</a></h3>

        <p>Cockpit does not allow files to be downloaded using
        drag-and-drop - unfortunately the Java Swing library makes
        this infeasible. To download objects from S3 you must
        select the objects you want, then choose the Object Menu
        item <b>Download object(s)</b>.</p>

        <p>Before downloading Cockpit compares any files present in
        the target location against the objects in S3 and detects
        any clashes (see <a href="#comparisons">Automatic File
        Comparisons</a>). If you download objects contained in a
        folder structure, that folder structure will be re-created
        exactly on your computer (provided the files were initially
        uploaded with a jets3t tool).</p>

        <p>Cockpit will automatically unzip GZipped objects and
        decrypt Encrypted objects, though you will have to set your
        encryption password in the Cockpit Preferences dialog
        before you can download encrypted objects.</p>

        <h3><a name="update-metadata">View or Modify Object
        Attributes</a></h3>

        <p>When you select the <b>View or Modify Object
        Attributes...</b> menu item for one or more objects,
        Cockpit displays the Object Attributes dialog.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Cockpit_ObjectAttributes.gif"
             alt="Picture of the Object Attributes dialog" /></p>

        <p>This dialog displays the attributes for each of the
        objects you selected, and you can step through multiple
        objects using the left and right arrow buttons. Each object
        has two kinds of attributes: standard attributes such as
        Size and Last Modified Date that you cannot change, and
        Metadata attributes such as Content-Type that you can
        change.</p>

        <p>In this dialog, you can add and remove the metadata
        items associated with an object using the green plus and
        minus buttons, and you can change the name or value of a
        metadata item by double-clicking an entry in the Metadata
        Attributes table. Note that metadata item names can contain
        only standard English (ASCII) characters and cannot contain
        spaces.</p>

        <p>The S3 service supports a subset of HTTP header metadata
        values, such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition. When
        you create a metadata item with a HTTP header name that S3
        recognizes, Cockpit will store the metadata using exactly
        this name. This means that you can easily set and change
        the content type value associated with an object in S3, and
        these HTTP header values will be returned to web browsers
        that access your objects.</p>

        <p>If you create a metadata item with a name that S3 will
        not recognize, such as "my-metadata-name", cockpit will
        automatically alter the metadata name behind the scenes to
        include the prefix <tt>x-amz-meta-</tt> prefix. This will
        allow S3 to store the metadata information even though it
        does not recognize the name as a valid HTTP header.</p>

        <h3><a name="copy-move-rename">Copy, Move or Rename
        Objects</a></h3>

        <p>When you select the <b>Copy or Move objects...</b> menu
        item for one or more objects, Cockpit displays the Copy or
        Move Objects dialog.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/Cockpit_CopyOrMoveObjects.gif"
             alt=
             "Picture of the Copy or Move Objects dialog" /></p>

        <p>This dialog allows you to do many things with the
        objects already stored in your S3 account.</p>

        <p>To copy objects from one bucket to another, select the
        name of the destination bucket in the <b>Copy to Bucket</b>
        field. To move objects to another bucket, first select the
        destination bucket then select the <b>Move Objects</b>
        checkbox. The only difference between copying and moving
        objects, is that when you select the move option Cockpit
        will automatically delete the original object
        <em>after</em> it has been successfully copied.</p>

        <p>As a convenience, Cockpit allows you to specify the
        access permissions that will apply to the newly copied or
        moved objects. If you leave the access permissions
        Unchanged, the new objects will have the same access
        control settings as the original objects. Alternatively,
        you can choose to make the new objects Private or Publicly
        Accessible.</p>

        <p>The Copy or Move Objects dialog also allows you to
        change the name of your S3 objects when they are copied or
        moved. By default, the names of the objects you copy or
        move will be left unchanged. However, if you select the
        <b>Rename objects with pattern</b> option you can specify a
        renaming pattern that will apply to each object.</p>

        <p>Renaming patterns can contain any text values, so you
        can easily rename a single S3 object by simply typing in
        its new name directly. However, things get more difficult
        when you are working with multiple objects at once, because
        each destination object must have a unique name. To help
        you rename multiple objects at a time, Cockpit supports a
        number of pattern variables that you can use to construct
        your destination object names. As you build your renaming
        pattern, Cockpit displays a preview of the object names
        that your pattern will produce, so you can make sure it is
        doing what you want.</p>

        <p>Here are the pattern variables you can use when renaming
        objects:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><tt>{key}</tt> The full key/name of the original
          objects. This variable is useful if you want to add a
          "subdirectory" prefix to your objects, in which case you
          could apply the pattern
          <tt>new/subdir/prefix/{key}</tt></li>

          <li><tt>{path}</tt> The "subdirectory" path of the
          original objects, for example an object named
          "this/is/my/object.txt" will have a path value of
          "this/is/my/".</li>

          <li><tt>{filename}</tt> The filename portion of the
          original objects' names, for example an object named
          "this/is/my/object.txt" will have a filename value of
          "object.txt". This variable is useful if you need to move
          objects stored in one "subdirectory" to another one, in
          which case you could apply the pattern
          <tt>new/subdir/{filename}</tt>.</li>

          <li><tt>{basename}</tt> The portion of the objects'
          filename prior to the extension, for example an object
          named "this/is/my/object.txt" will have a basename value
          of "object". This variable is useful if you need to
          change the filename extensions for a number of objects,
          in which case you could apply the pattern
          <tt>{basename}.newext</tt>. If the original objects
          included a "subdirectory" portion in their names, you can
          retain this path informaiton by including the {path}
          variable like so: <tt>{path}{basename}.newext</tt>.</li>

          <li><tt>{ext}</tt> The extension portion of the objects'
          filenames, for example an object named
          "this/is/my/object.txt" will have an ext value of
          "txt".</li>

          <li><tt>{count}</tt> This variable assigns a unique
          integer value to every object in alphabetical order,
          starting from 1. This variable is not likely to be useful
          very often, but it may help if you need to move multiple
          objects with the same name into a single
          "subdirectory".</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="acls">Access Control Lists</a></h3>

        <p>Amazon S3 uses Access Control List (ACL) settings to
        control who may access or modify items stored in S3. By
        default, all buckets and objects created in S3 are
        accessible only to the account owner - they are completely
        private.</p>

        <p>Cockpit allows you to change the ACL settings for a
        bucket, or for one or more objects, by selecting the Update
        Access Control List menu item in the bucket or object
        menus. ACL settings are managed in the Update Access
        Control List dialog.</p>

             alt=
             "Picture of the Access Control Listing Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>The default ACL setting is for the object's creator,
        represented by a Canonical ID, to have Full control.</p>

        <p>The most common ACL change is to allow public access to
        a bucket or object. An object is made publicly accessible
        in S3 by granting READ access to members of the All Users
        group. To do this:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Click the plus (+) button underneath the Group
          Grantees table, to add a new Group permission</li>

          <li>Make sure the Group URI is set to
          <tt>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers</tt>
          by double-clicking the URI and selecting it</li>

          <li>Set the Permission option to <tt>READ</tt> if
          necessary by double-clicking it</li>

          <li>Save the changes using the <b>Save Permission
          Changes</b> button</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note that you can also used <a href="#signedurls">signed
        GET URLs</a> to make an object publicly available for a
        limited time.</p>

        <p>Although all ACL combinations supported by Amazon S3 can
        be managed using this dialog box, this is a complex topic
        and we won't deal with it here. Please refer to Amazon's
        technical documentation for more information about the use
        of Access Control Lists.</p>

        <h3><a name="filecomparisions">Automatic File
        Comparisons</a></h3>

        <p>Cockpit automatically compares files that are being
        uploaded or downloaded with files in the destination to
        detect clashes. When a file with the same name exists on
        the target, Cockpit determines whether the file has
        changed, and if so which version of the file is the most
        recent.</p>

        <p>Each file is given one of the following status
        types:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>New File: The file does not exist in the
          destination</li>

          <li>Unchanged: The file is identical to the copy in the
          destination</li>

          <li>Changed: The file has been changed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If there are Unchanged or Changed files, the <b>Replace
        file(s)</b> dialog is displayed.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/FileComparisonsDialog.jpg"
             alt=
             "Picture of the File Comparisons Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>This dialog allows you to choose which clashing files in
        the destination should be replaced, if any. The options
        available may include the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Only upload/download new file(s)</b>: Only files
          that do not already exist in the destination will be
          uploaded or downloaded. No existing file will be
          over-written.</li>

          <li><b>Upload/download new and changed file(s)</b>: New
          files and changed files will be transferred, but files
          that are unchanged will not be transferred. Only
          out-dated files will be over-written.</li>

          <li><b>Upload/Download all files</b>: All the files will
          be uploaded or downloaded, regardless of what files are
          in the destination. Any existing files will be
          over-written.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>File comparisons are performed using MD5 hashes of the
        file contents.</p>

        <h3><a name="signedurls">Signed GET URLs</a></h3>

        <p>A private object stored in S3 can be made publicy
        available for a limited time using a signed GET URL. The
        signed URL can be used by anyone to download the object by
        using the URL in their web browser, up until a chosen time
        after which the URL will no longer work.</p>

        <p>Time limited URLs are created using Object Menu item
        <b>Generate Public GET URL...</b>. A dialog is displayed
        prompting for the number of hours until the URL will
        expire. This number can be a fraction, for example the
        value 0.5 will create a URL which works for half an hour.
        If the object is stored in a bucket that is accessible via
        a virtual host name, for example
        <i>http://my.hostname.com</i>, you can create a signed URL
        based on that host name by ticking the "Bucket is a virtual
        host?" checkbox.</p>

        <p><img src="cockpit_assets/SignedGetURLDialog.jpg"
             alt=
             "Picture of the Signed GET URL Dialog window" /></p>

        <p>After providing the number of hours the dialog box will
        contain a lengthy URL. This URL will work in any web
        browser, but only for the length of time you specified.
        Send this URL to the person who needs the object.</p>

        <h3><a name="config">Advanced Configuration</a></h3>

        <p>Users can configure Cockpit using the advanced
        configuration files described in the <a href=
        "../toolkit/configuration.html">Configuration</a>
        section.</p>

        <p>When Cockpit starts it looks for configuration files in
        the directory <b>&lt;UserHome&gt;/.jets3t</b>. If this
        directory exists and contains files called
        <tt>jets3t.properties</tt> and/or <tt>mime.types</tt> it
        will load the properties from these files, adding to or
        replacing any default configurations.</p>

        <p>Files in the user's home directory will be read whether
        Cockpit is run in stand-alone more, or as an applet. This
        configuration option is most useful for those users who run
        Cockpit as an online applet, but wish to have more control
        over their own settings.</p>
