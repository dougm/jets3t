        <h1>Gatekeeper Concepts</h1>

        <p>A Gatekeeper service acts as an intermediary between a
        Client and an S3 Account, on behalf of a Service Provider
        who owns the S3 Account. The Service Provider configures
        the gatekeeper service to perform one or more of the
        following tasks:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Allow clients to interact with S3 by providing the
          client with signed URLs</li>

          <li>Authorize or deny access to particular clients, based
          on some kind of access control rules</li>

          <li>Control how data is stored in S3, such as by choosing
          which bucket to store objects in or by re-naming objects
          to match an organizational structure imposed by the
          service provider</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Gatekeeper services authorizes client operations using
        the S3 <a href=
        "http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/RESTAuthentication.html"
           target="_blank">Query String Authorization</a> URL
           signing mechanism to generate time-limited URLs that
           client applications use to Upload, Download, and Delete
           objects in S3.</p>

        <h2>Interaction</h2>

        <p><img src="gatekeeper-concepts_assets/gatekeeper-uml.jpg"
             alt="Client/Gatekeeper interaction diagram" /></p>

        <h3>Client request message</h3>

        <p>A client application contacts the Gatekeeper service
        when it wishes to perform an operation on objects in the S3
        account. There operations can include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>PUT</b>: The client will upload a file or some
          data to S3</li>

          <li><b>GET</b>: The client will retrieve an object from
          S3</li>

          <li><b>HEAD</b>: The client will retrieve information
          about an object from S3 (this is not likely to be used
          often)</li>

          <li><b>DELETE</b>: The client will delete an object in
          S3</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The client application includes a separate "request" for
        each operation it wishes to perform.</p>

        <h3>Gatekeeper response message</h3>

        <p>The Gatekeeper service evaluates the client's request(s)
        and responds with a signed URL for each operation it will
        allow, or without a signed URL for operations it will not
        allow along with a brief explanation of the reason.</p>

        <p>The evaluation the Gatekeeper service performs can vary
        considerably - from allowing every operation, to
        restricting operations to authorized clients, through to
        manipulating the name, location and metadata of objects. If
        the service is renaming objects or changing metadata, the
        response message may include information about this changes
        if it is necessary for the client application to react
        appropriately. For example, if the Gateway service requires
        the Content-Type of a client's file upload to be changed
        the client application must be made aware of this change to
        perform an upload that will match the signed URL returned
        by the Gateway.</p>

        <h3>Client performs operations</h3>

        <p>Once the client application has received a response
        message from the Gatekeeper service, it can perform the
        operations for which the service provided signed URLs.</p>

        <p>As mentioned above, if the Gatekeeper service applied
        certain kinds of changes the client application will have
        to recognise additional information in the Gatekeeper's
        response message and react appropriately.</p>

        <h2>Gatekeeper Messages</h2>

        <p>To capture the information necessary to perform the
        interactions described above a flexible message format is
        required. The message format must provide means for the
        client to provide information to the Gatekeeper describing
        the operations it intends to perform, and for the
        Gatekeeper to respond with allowed and/or denied operations
        as well as any object changes it expects the client to make
        before performing the operations. Finally, in more advanced
        interaction scenarios the Gatekeeper or Client application
        might need to capture additional application-specific
        information in the message, such as transaction ID unique
        to that interaction. So the message format must be able to
        represent client requests ranging from the simple to the
        complex, and it ideally it should also be compatible with a
        wide range of server-side technologies.</p>

        <p>The Gatekeeper Message format meets these requirements
        by building messages based around a series of properties
        (name/value pairs) where the name of each property is
        organised into a hierarchy. The message captures three
        kinds of message properties:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Request properties</b>: Properties describing the
          operation a client wishes to perform, particularly the
          type of operation and the S3 object the operation will be
          performed on. There is a set of request properties for
          each S3 object the client wishes to operate on, with each
          set identified using a simple numbered <b>id</b> which
          starts at 0 for the first object, is 1 for the second
          object etc.</li>

          <li><b>Message properties</b>: Properties concerning the
          gatekeeper message as a whole, such as a unique
          identifier the Gatekeeper may set for each message it
          processes</li>

          <li><b>Application properties</b>: Properties specific to
          the client application sending the message. These may be
          used to include additional information from or to the
          client.</li>
        </ul>

            there will be no corresponding <b>signedUrl</b>

            <br />
            The JetS3t Gateway servlet uses a message property to
            include a message-specific transaction id, eg
            <b>message|transactionId=1234</b></td>

            <td>Any property specific to a client application.
            <br />
            For example, a client application may prompt a user for
            a password or some other information that an advanced
            Gatekeeper service will use to decide whether or not to
            allow an operation.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Message Usage</h3>

        <p>The Gatekeeper request message is intended to be a
        standard HTTP POST requests, where each property in the
        message is sent as a POST parameter. The Gatekeeper
        response should be a plain text document, where each
        property is on a separate line and is represented as
        <b>propertyName=propertyValue</b>.</p>

        <h2>Gatekeeper Authorization and Control</h2>

        <p>The level of control a Gatekeeper service imposes over
        S3 operations can vary from none, where the service allows
        any client to perform operations, through to the high
        degree of control imposed when the service renames objects
        and adds or changes object metadata. This section discusses
        a few different ways that Gatekeeper control could be
        implemented, though the exact level of control required
        will depend entirely on the kind of service or application
        a Service Provider is offering.</p>

        <h3>Basic authorization</h3>

        <p>The simplest form of client authorization would be to
        use the standard web-server mechanism of Basic
        Authorization, where a client must provider a valid
        username and password before they can even submit a request
        to the Gatekeeper service. With this mechanism the
        Gatekeeper service could be extremely simple and allow all
        operations requested by clients, knowing that the Basic
        Authorization requirement will prevent any unauthorized
        clients from reaching it.</p>

        <h3>End-point authorization</h3>

        <p>When clients submit HTTP POST requests over the Internet
        certain information about that client will be available to
        any server-side service. This information can include the
        client's IP or DNS address, the User Agent description
        provided by the client's application, and even the client's
        authorized username if Basic Authorization is turned
        on.</p>

        <p>Gatekeeper services could use the client's end-point
        information to control authorization, such as by only
        authorizing clients with a specific end-point IP addresses
        or clients in a particular address range (eg the computers
        in a business' network).</p>

        <h3>Object-specific authorization</h3>

        <p>As the client must provide information about which
        objects it wishes to operate upon to receive the
        appropriate signed URL, the Gatekeeper service can use this
        information to decide whether or not to allow particular
        clients or even particular operations in a client's
        request. The simplest example of this is the Content-Type
        object metadata item, which clients must include in their
        requests for PUT URLs before they can upload objects to S3.
        If the Service Provider wished to limit the type of files
        uploaded to S3, they could dis-allow any PUT operation
        where the Content-Type was not allowed.</p>

        <p>This technique relies on the client providing the
        necessary information for the Gatekeeper to make a
        decision. In some cases information must be provided by the
        client for certain operations (such as with the
        Content-Type for PUTs) so the Gatekeeper can count on
        having this information available. In other cases the
        obejct information available will depend entirely on what
        metadata the client application applies to objects, and how
        much of that information it includes in requests to the
        Gatekeeper.</p>

        <p>In the worst case, the Gatekeeper could simply deny
        access to any client application which did not provide the
        necessary information.</p>

        <h3>Application-specific authorization</h3>

        <p>The most sophisticated authorization control can be
        imposed when a client application is designed to include
        application-specific information in its request messages.
        This information could be anything at all that is
        appropriate for the kind of service the Service Provider is
        offering. For example, the client application itself could
        prompt for username and password details which are
        encrypted before being sent to the Gatekeper - this would
        be an improvement on standard Basic Authorization as
        passwords would not be sent in easily readable
        plain-text.</p>

        <p>The possibilities of this approach are basically
        unlimited, as long as the Service Provider has control over
        both the Gatekeeper service and the client's
        application.</p>

        <h3>Controlling Objects</h3>

        <p>A Gatekeeper service can have a reasonable degree of
        control over the operations performed on objects in an S3
        account. In addition to authorizing which clients can
        perform operations, and even which particular operations a
        client can perform, the service can control the name,
        location and metadata of objects a client operates on.</p>

        <p>This last level of control is possible due to the way
        signed URLs work. When a Gatekeeper service provides a
        client with a signed URL, that URL may or may not reference
        the object the client actually requested. The client
        application doesn't care about this, as long as the signed
        URL works for performing the requested operation the
        content of the URL is not important (though the client
        application may have to be aware of some changes in the
        case of PUT URLs).</p>

        <p>For example, consider a client application that uploads
        and downloads files in an S3 account. This application
        doesn't know much about the S3 service or how it works, all
        it knows is that it receives URLs from the Gatekeeper to do
        its work.
        <br />
        Let's say the client wants to upload the file MyMovie.avi
        to S3. The client application requests a PUT URL with the
        following very simple request message:</p>
        <pre>
request|0|signatureType=put
request|0|objectKey=MyMovie.avi
</pre>

        <p>Notice that there is no <tt>request.0.bucketName</tt>
        property, nor a <tt>request.0.metadata.content-type</tt>
        property. The client application only knows to provide the
        file's name.</p>

        <p>The Gatekeeper service now has the job of deciding where
        this object should be stored. Because the client has been
        authorized using some mechanism (such as Basic
        Authorization) the service knows that the client is the
        user <b>Mr Tickle</b>. The service decides that files from
        this user belong in the <b>Mr Men</b> bucket in S3, and
        that the object key should be prefixed with a "directory"
        name specifically for Mr Tickle. Finally, the service
        recognises that the .avi file is a movie with the mime type
        <b>video/x-msvideo</b>.</p>

        <p>The Gatekeeper service replies with the following
        response message (signedUrl is all one line):</p>
        <pre>
request|0|signatureType=put

        <p>The first three request properties, objectKey and
        bucketName, are returned as a courtesy and the client
        application can ignore them. The important item is the
        signedUrl, which is a signed PUT request for uploading a
        file to the bucket <b>MrMen</b> with the object key
        <b>MrTickle/MyMovie.avi</b>. When the client application
        uses this URL in a PUT operation with the file data, the
        file will be uploaded to the location the Gatekeeper
        service specified.</p>

        <p><b>Warning</b>: One important thing to note in this case
        is that because the Gatekeeper changed the Content-Type
        metadata item, the client application must also use the
        same Content-Type HTTP header when performing the PUT
        operation. As Content-Type HTTP header is among a small set
        of headers that are always included in a signed PUT URL,
        the client application must send the same value when
        communicating with S3. The following metadata items must
        match between the signed URL and the HTTP PUT headers:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Content-Type</li>

          <li>Content-MD5</li>

          <li>Any S3-specific metadata item prefixed with
          <b>x-amz</b></li>
        </ul>
