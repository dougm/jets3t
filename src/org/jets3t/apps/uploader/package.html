Provides the Uploader application, a simple wizard-based application that S3 account holders 
(Service Providers) may provide to clients to allow them to upload files to S3 without requiring 
access to the Service Provider's S3 credentials. The Uploader accesses S3 accounts via a 
Gatekeeper service. The Gatekeeper is a specialised application that will only be of interest to 
Service Providers who use S3 for storage behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
The Uploader is likely to be useful mainly to Service Providers who will use this document to 
customise and brand the application, and configure it to interact with their own Gatekeeper 
service which the Uploader will contact for permission to perform operations in S3. All 
configuration is performed in the <tt>uploader.properties</tt> configuration file, such as the 
one available in the <b>configs</b> directory of the JetS3t distribution.
