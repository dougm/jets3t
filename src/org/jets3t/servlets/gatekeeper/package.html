<p>
Provides the Gatekeeper servlet application, a server-side authorization 
service that acts as a Gatekeeper server for S3 operations. The servlet
receives requests for S3 operations (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE) and responds to 
these requests with either a signed URL allowing the operation, or a message 
stating that the operation will not be allowed.
</p>
<p>
Basic decision-making functionality is included with the JetS3t suite, 
however it is straight-forward to obtain more advanced control over the 
Gatekeeper's behaviour by implementing the relevant Java interfaces. There 
are specific interfaces for: allowing/denying requests, signing URLs, and 
assigning unique transaction IDs for a request.
</p>
<p>
The Gatekeeper is designed to work closely with the 
<a href="../../apps/uploader/package-summary.html">Uploader</a>
 application, providing it with signed URLs so the Uploader can add items to an S3 account 
without the end-user having any access to the AWS account credentials.
