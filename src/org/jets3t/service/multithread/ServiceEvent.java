/**
 * Base class of all events produced by {@link S3ServiceMulti}.
 * <p>
 * Every event has an event code that indicates the state of a process when the event was
 * generated. The event code will also give a guide as to what information the event will contain.
 * <p>
 * The event codes, and their meanings, are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>EVENT_STARTED: An S3 operation has commenced, but no work has yet been done.</li>
 * <li>EVENT_IN_PROGRESS: An S3 operation is in progress. Progress events are fired at regular time
 *     intervals, and will include information about any work that have been completed 
 *     as part of the overall operation.</li>
 * <li>EVENT_COMPLETED: An S3 operation has completed, and all the work has been done.</li>
 * <li>EVENT_CANCELLED: An S3 operation was started but has been cancelled before it could complete. 
 *     If an operation is cancelled, this event will be fired instead of the EVENT_COMPLETED.</li>
 * <li>EVENT_ERROR: An S3 operation has failed and an exception has been thrown. The error 
 *     will be availble from {@link #getErrorCause()}</li>
 * <li>EVENT_IGNORED_ERRORS: One or more operations have failed but ,because the 
 *     "s3service.ignore-exceptions-in-multi" JetS3t property value is set to true,
 *     the overall operation has continued. The errors will be available from 
 *     {@link #getIgnoredErrors()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * EVENT_STARTED and EVENT_IN_PROGRESS events may include a {@link ThreadWatcher} object containing
 * detailed information about the progress of an S3 operation, such as how many threads have 
 * completed and, of uploads and downloads, how many bytes have been transferred at what speed and
 * how long until the transfer is complete.
 * <p>
 * See the event object specific to the operation you are performing for more details about the
 * information available in service events.
