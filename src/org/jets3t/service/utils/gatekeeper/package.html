<p>
Provides the Gatekeeper servlet, a server-side application for authorizing client applications 
to interact with an S3 account without providing the client with the AWS login credentials. 
The Gatekeeper uses the S3 
<a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/RESTAuthentication.html" target="_blank">Query String Authorization</a>
URL signing capabilities to generate time-limited URLs that client applications use to Upload, 
Download, and Delete objects in S3. 
</p>
<p>
Gatekeeper is primarily intended for situations where a service provider has an S3 account where 
they store data on behalf of clients. The service provider manages the S3 storage on behalf of the 
client, who need not know or care that S3 is the underlying technology being used.
</p>
<p>
Gatekeeper was designed to work with the <a href="../../apps/Uploader.html">Uploader</a> 
client-side application that is included in the JetS3t suite.
