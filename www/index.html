<h2>What is JetS3t?</h2>
<p>
JetS3t is a free, open-source Java toolkit and application suite for the 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s3" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3).
The toolkit provides Java programmers with a powerful yet simple API for interacting with 
S3 and managing data stored there, while the applications allow anyone to easily manage and 
interact with their S3 accounts.

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>
JetS3t was started as a hobbyist project to simply backup files to S3 but with feedback, support 
and sponsorship from our users it has since grown into a very powerful suite including an 
underlying toolkit API and some widely-used applications built on top of this toolkit.
</p>
<p>
The JetS3t suite will continue to evolve as new feature are added to Amazon's S3 and as we receive 
your feedback, so get involved and help us improve the suite to better meet your needs.
</p>

<h2>What is Amazon S3?</h2>
The Amazon Simple Storage Service is a paid-for online file storage service 
offered by Amazon. The chief benefits of S3 are:
<ul>
	<li>It's quite cheap</li>
	<li>You can store unlimited files, including large files (up to 5GB)</li>
	<li>Amazon handles the underlying distributed storage network, so you don't have to</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is this toolkit called JetS3t?</h2>
<p>
JetS3t, pronounced "jet-set", stands for the <b>J</b>ava <b>S3</b> toolkit, with some extra letters 
added to make it into a word connoting high-flying, free-wheeling luxury. Come and join the jet-set,
you won't regret it.
